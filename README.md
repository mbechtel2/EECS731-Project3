## EECS731 Project3 - Weekend movie trip

In this project, I perform clustering on given datasets for movie reviews with the goal of finding movies that are similar to one another. I specifically look at the average ratings and individual genres for each movie. In the end, I find that some of the clustering methods can be used for successfully grouping movies together, while others fail to do so and instead find clusters that mix movies that are categorized as a specific genres with other movies that aren't.
